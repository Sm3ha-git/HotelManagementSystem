# Hotel Management System

This is a **simple hotel management system** implemented in pure **Java**, without a graphical user interface (GUI). It serves as an introductory project to understand fundamental Java programming concepts and object-oriented principles.

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: 
  - Add new guests.
  - Check room availability.
  - Assign rooms to guests.
  - Generate bills for guests upon checkout.
- **Data Handling**: All data is managed in-memory using Java arrays.
- **Console-Based Interaction**: Input and output are handled via the console, offering a straightforward way to interact with the program.

## Purpose
This project introduces beginners to Java by covering essential programming concepts, such as:
- **Classes and Objects**: To represent guests, rooms, and bookings.
- **Encapsulation**: Using getters and setters to manage class data.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: For reusable and extendable code.
- **Control Structures**: Loops, conditionals.

## How It Works
1. The program starts by displaying a menu of available options.
2. Users input their choice, and the program guides them through the corresponding process.
3. Guest and room details are stored and managed dynamically during runtime.
4. When a guest checks out, the system calculates the bill and displays it on the console.

## Why This Project?
This small hotel management system is ideal for beginners to:
- Learn Java syntax and basic programming structures.
- Understand how to design and interact with objects (OOP intro).
